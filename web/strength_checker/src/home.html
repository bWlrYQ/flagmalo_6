		StrengthChecker, this is the name of the new app you can't ignore... You've always been 
		wondering if your passwords are secure enough to resist a bruteforce attack ? You do not
		trust all these online services (and you are right), they all store your data and passwords
		in order to sell it all to hackers ! 
                </p>
		<p class="h6">
		We have the solution you need ðŸ˜„, it's called "StrengthChecker". But what is StrengthChecker ? 
		Well, it's a small executable you can use locally to test if your password is strong enough or 
		not to resist a bruteforce attack. Our tool is fully compliant with ANSSI's recommandations on 
		passwords so don't worry about that. On the other hand as it is fully local you have the assurance
		that nothing goes through the Internet and that the passwords you check are all safe !

		If ever you want to test, use, or just look at our tool, you can go to the application page
		by clicking <a href="?view=app.html">here</a>
